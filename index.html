    <h2>About the film</h2>

    <p>
        Struggling with alcoholism, Dan Torrance remains traumatized by the sinister events that occurred at the
        Overlook Hotel when he was a child. His hope for a peaceful existence soon becomes shattered when he meets Abra,
        a teen who shares his extrasensory gift of the "shine." Together, they form an unlikely alliance to battle the
        True Knot, a cult whose members try to feed off the shine of innocents to become immortal.

                <em>"A body of work that benefits from hindsight and reflection - unexpected pleasures for a horror
                    movie, which must be why they feel so welcome."</em><span class="bold"> - K. Austin Collins <span

                <em>"Whichever route you prefer to take to the Overlook Hotel, there are better directions available
                    than those
                    prescribed by Doctor Sleep."</em><span class="bold"> - Barry Hertz <span class="critic"><span

                <em>"I think what I respected the most about Doctor Sleep is that it does feel like it's trying to be
                    its own film for as long as it can."</em><span class="bold"> - Amy Nicholson <span

                <em>" 'Doctor Sleep' feels like the logical continuation to Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of 'The
                    Shining'."</em><span class="bold"> - Matthew Rozsa <span class="critic"><span
